# Helpful-Arch-Linux-Things

This is a log of diffrent tools and file structures for Arch linux (my personal OS). 
I have alot of issues when using this operating system and decided that logging my solutions to problems could help my future self and hopefully others so that no one has to go through the tedium i went through to find a solution.

Dont give up! After getting frustrated the solution is usually one good nights sleep away.
